Date: 2014-07-26 3:00PM

I currently work on data and machine learning infrastructure at [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) and previously on search quality at [Yahoo!](https://www.yahoo.com/). I am mostly interested in big data, distributed systems, and programming languages, especially functional programming languages like [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/). I'm a polyglot who's done C, C++, [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), Scala, [Clojure](http://clojure.org/), JavaScript and [PHP](https://php.net/) professionally.

In my past life as a part-time recording engineer I worked with a couple of bands in Hong Kong like [Audiotraffic](https://myspace.com/audiotrafficband), [Hardpack](https://myspace.com/hardpack), [Helium3](http://www.h3lium3.com/) and [Qiu Hong](https://www.facebook.com/qiuhonghk). I also did sound effects for a couple of movies including [The Heavenly Kings](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800362/) and [Soundless Wind Chime](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1360832/).

I enjoying shredding both my [Keyboardio Model 01](https://shop.keyboard.io/) at work and my lefty guitars at home. I'm also a trained [technical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_diving) and [cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_diving) diver.
