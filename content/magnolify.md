It's been a while since I last posted or given talks on new content. I atteneded [Northeast Scala Symposium 2020](https://nescala.io/) virtually last week and talked about some interested learnings from type class derivation with [Magnolia](https://github.com/propensive/magnolia) with my coworker Claire M. Most of the code are open sourced in [Magnolify](https://github.com/spotify/magnolify). Here are the [slides](/slides/magnolify.html).
